# gINIrator
gINIrator is a passion project with a goal of creating a simple GUI application for generating INI scripts for C&amp;C Generals: Zero Hour
I am currently an outcast in modding community so you wont be seeing me in moddb at all.
This is a side project that i started in 2020. since the release of Zero Hour's source code, and increasing viability of vibe coding, i got some energy back to continue this project.
